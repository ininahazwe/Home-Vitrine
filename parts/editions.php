    <p class="intro">
      After a successful experience in Ghana, we were empowered by our mentors
      and peers at CRI-Paris to continue our educational efforts. Furthermore, we
      were able to put out together our specializations around the implementation of
      digital and frugal technologies for sustainable solutions.<br /><br />
      Therefore, over the
      course of the 2019-2020 academic year we focused on the development of
      project-based activities to create a summer school for students with the goal of
      developing new skills.
